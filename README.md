# SSAC 2026 - Integrated Contextual Rating (ICR) Research

This repository supports the research to be presented in the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference (SSAC) 2026 abstract titled *"The Unseen Game: Quantifying Hidden Value in T20 Cricket Using a Novel Metric that Blends Match Context, Venue-wise Performance, and Role-Based Volatility"* by Omkar Walunj. It contains data and code snippets related to the development of the Integrated Contextual Rating (ICR) and Bowling ICR (BICR) metrics for evaluating player performance in T20 cricket, with a focus on the 2025 IPL season.

## Repository Structure

- **Dataset**: Contains ball-by-ball (bbb) data used as the foundation for this research. Note: The raw dataset requires cleaning and preprocessing, which is not included in the code to maintain data integrity and focus on the metric calculations.
- **Results**: Includes computed ICR and BICR values for 2025 IPL players, derived from the processed data. These results reflect the application of the novel metric and are intended for validation and analysis purposes.
- **ICR_project_code**: Contains Python code snippets specifically for calculating ICR and BICR. This is provided to encourage open-source collaboration, aligning with SSAC’s communal spirit.

## Purpose
This work introduces ICR and BICR, metrics that blend match context, venue-wise performance, and role-based volatility to uncover hidden player value in T20 cricket. The methodology integrates Venue-Adjusted Performance (VAP), Win-Probability Added (WPA), and a Role Stability Factor (RSF) to optimize team strategies, as explored in the 2025 IPL context.

## Acknowledgments
This research builds on publicly available cricket data and is inspired by the analytics community’s efforts to advance sports science.
